# Deadmart
DeadMart is an open-source template inspired by the in-game shop interface of Deadlock. This project aims to provide a starting point for developers looking to recreate or customize similar UI elements.

Big thanks to [@lukeschaefer](https://github.com/lukeschaefer) and [@Hexe](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=68961896) for their incredible resources. Without their online contributions, this project would have taken much longer to complete.

Feel free to use or adapt this project as needed. However, please note that this work is not my intellectual propertyâ€”it belongs to Valve.
